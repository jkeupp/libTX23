# libTX23
contoller software for the TX23 Anemometer

# DISCLAIMER
This piece of software is in development stage and currently only works for my setup at home. I hope that in the near future I'll have time to update the repo, add a documentation and provide some usage videos/tutorials.
Until then, feel free to drop me an email if you have any questions.
